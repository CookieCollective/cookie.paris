Anything longer will be cut by the almighty god of the demoscene, so you may want to cut beforehand if you need control over the ending.</li><li>Any music style or tech is welcome, from chiptune, amiga-style sounds to the latest hype sequencer.</li><li>Reminder: if you are registered with SACEM, GEMA, or any other right-holding organization, you CANNOT enter this competition.

It's recommended to take a picture of your dish and to set it as the entry's screenshot.</li></ul><a class="anchor" name="laser"></a><h2>Laser</h2><p>It's like working on up to 4 oscilloscopes, but a lot bigger.</p><p>We anticipate some really unseen and blasting uber visuals with the first ever multilasers compo.</p><p>Lasers are definately not pixels, it's lines across point lists countinusly redrawn. It's damn simple and highly challenging to overcome/use strong hardware limitations : *welcome out of the box !!*</p><ul><li>There are 2x RGB phatty and 2x RGY sharp beams for everyone. You may use one or more lasers in your demo. There are some clever tricks to find like: using sharp beams for forefront and phatty beams for background ?</li><li>All lasers are hooked to etherdream controllers. Etherdream libraries are available for major langs. Use the one you like.</li><li>If you are a laser freak, you can also bring/show off/use your DIY system micro controller based. For custom hardware, check out the <a href="#wild">Wild competition</a>. Ask orga before bringing any extra laser system for safety check.</li><li>Limited spare computers will be available. Ask the laser guys if you want to try something new and join this compo.</li><li>For efficiency, *no wifi access* to the lasers LAN. You MUST bring your RJ45 USB dongle if needed.</li></ul><p>There will be a room dedicated to laser coding at the party. However, one laser+etherdream will be available for test from now on, every Wednesday during the Jack hackerspace open meeting, Metro Buzenval. Remember that there is some frameworks with simulators, see the bootstrap link below.</p><p>Useful links:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.neurohack.cc/index.php?title=LaserBootstrap">How to / boostrap in different lang.</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/tmplab/LJay">Multi lasers in python (GitHub repository).</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/tmpbci/demo_laser">Minimal one laser demo, from Cookie Demoparty 2017.</a></li></ul><a class="anchor" name="wild"></a><h2>Wild</h2><p>Anything that doesn't fit in the previous competitions.
